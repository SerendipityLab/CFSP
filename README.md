# CFSP
Crypto Fund Syndicate Protocol a set of smart contracts of the next generation, the basis of which will be artificial intelligence. CFSP will be executed on any CFCF-supported blockbuster and allows for the formation of "fast" syndicates, and at peak moments, a financial lever comparable to global GDP - trillions of dollars.

1. AI will not be the prerogative of funds, it will be a cloud or local downloadable service with a wide range of functions and its end user will be people. Modern Siri and its analogues will expand their functions, including the functions of investment analysts and managers. People and funds as intermediaries are not needed

2. A device on which the new type of AI will function will be something between the desktop, smartphone, augmented reality glasses and a neuron interface with the brain. This device will not be embodied in one place - it will be a super cloud, "smeared" in different local and cloud environments.

3. All that concerns financial and any transactions, identity, documents and reputation will be distributed in a variety of different blockages, both public and private.

4. The source of information for AI will be a large network of oracles, distributed both in the physical world through IoT, and in the virtual world.

5. The main task of an individual AI will not be investment, but the forecasting and support of an individual trajectory of development for any person. See Future Education System 2.0

6. Assistance in financial management will be only one of the functions of AI, including the management of costs, payments, loans, insurance, pensions, and so on. and investments.

7. AI will analyze the state of the world economy and millions of enterprises, emittents, funds and projects requesting investment and support. This will be an analysis of hundreds of millions of opportunities.

8. Based on the specified parameters, AI will manage payments and investments, while the duration of the asset stay in the portfolio will be greatly reduced, because the speed of development will grow at times.

9. Generating any idea immediately will automatically generate a request for support, and submit an application to various communities, funds, exchanges, scientific centers.

10. All AI will immediately know that a new idea has appeared, a new point of meaning and growth, and there is a request for support.

11. At the same time, individual AI people will communicate with other AI individuals and organizations, "negotiating" all the necessary resources. People in this industry will not, they have nothing to do here.

12. The task of people to generate is go, discuss them with other people, and embody. All functions of financial management will be automated.

13. Since a lot of versions of blockages implementing their functions will be created, at a certain stage there will be a need for a meta layer that will allow "negotiating" different AIs and different blockers and crypto-currencies.

14. This layer will be implemented in the form of Crypto Fund Syndicate Protocol - as a language, a set of rules that allow creating "fast networks of investors, sponsors and projects" in the scale-free-network architecture, on top of the hardware and architectural level of individual blockrooms.

15. The analogy here is that blocking and low-level smart contracts form the physical level of the network, this is like a network of neurons, axons and synapses in the brain that can have different functions.
